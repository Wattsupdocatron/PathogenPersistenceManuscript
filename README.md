# PathogenPersistenceManuscript
Analysis scripts for metagenomics/metatranscriptomics for pathogen persistence in freshwater manuscript. 

Where specified, each file set was analysed individually rather than with loops - i.e. the code that is reported in each file is a representative for a single metagenomics/metatranscriptomics file. 
The input/ouput file names can be changed depending on the sample being analysed.
